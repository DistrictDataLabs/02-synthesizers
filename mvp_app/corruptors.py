'''
1)      Missing Value corrupter

a.       “Replaces attribute value with an empty string.”

2)      Character edit corrupter

a.       “This function randomly selects a position in an attribute value (based on real-world studies more likely towards the middle or end of a value”

3)      Keyboard corrupter:

a.       “This function simulates a typing error and randomly replaces a character with a neighboring character according to the to a keyboard layout matrix.  Different probabilistic can be set for selecting a replacement in a row and or column”

4)      Optical Character recognition corrupter

a.       “This function is based on a look-up file that contains pairs of character sequences that have similar shapes, such as 5 ß> S or m ßàr n.  Such pairs can model OCR errors.”

5)      Phonetic corrupter

a.       “This function simulates phonetic variations (for example for names that sound similar).  It is based on a look-up file that contains pairs of phonetic variations of sub-strings, such as ph ßà f, or rie ßà ry

6)      Categorical value swap corrupter:

a.       “The corruption function can be applied on specific categorical attributes by using a look-up file that contains categorical values and their variations (such as misspellings and nicknames). “
